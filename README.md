Available format:

* ##########
* ###-###-####
* ###.###.####

## Address
When specifying an address all fields are **mandatory** except in cases when an address already exists on a profile and it is only being modified.
### Country value
The country must be a two letter ISO code. See [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1).

### Province / State value

* The **province/state** must be part of the country. If not, it will be considered as an invalid selection.
* For the case where the no **provinces/state** are available in the data, only a value is required.
